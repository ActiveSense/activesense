- ‚öôÔ∏è **Efficient Data Processing**  
  Optimized R-based analysis engine significantly reduces processing time compared to the original workflow.

- üîÑ **Dual Analysis**  
  Simultaneous processing of both sleep and activity data.

- üìä **Interactive Visualizations**  
  Clear and informative charts suitable for both clinical professionals and patients.

- üíª **Cross-Platform Support**  
  Compatible with **Windows** and **macOS**.

- üöÄ **Streamlined Workflow**  
  Simplified process from data import to report generation.

- üìÅ **Data Export**  
  Export analysis results in **PDF** and **CSV** formats for sharing and archiving.

## **Technical Architecture**

The application leverages a modern, efficient technology stack:

- **Frontend**: `C#/.NET` with **Avalonia UI** for cross-platform compatibility  
- **Backend Analysis**: Optimized `R scripts`  
- **Data Visualization**: `LiveChartsCore.SkiaSharpView`  
- **Data Serialization**: `JSON` for configuration and export  

---

## **Project Structure**

The solution is divided into two main components:

### **1. ActiveSense.Desktop**
The primary desktop application including:
- User interface components  
- Data processing services  
- Visualization models  
- Export functionality  

### **2. ActiveSense.RScripts**
The R-based analysis engine including:
- Data segmentation algorithms  
- Sleep analysis functions  
- Activity analysis functions  
- Utility functions
